# Code & Coffee: Uptown Brigade
## How to Organize
### Inspired by and adapted from (Code & Coffee: Vancouver)[https://github.com/Code-and-Coffee-YVR]

This repo exists to help ensure that Code & Coffee is run consistently each time, to help onboard new organizers, and to share information with other groups.

Learning how to effectively run a Meetup has taken many months. It would be a shame if all of that learning were to vanish if the current organizers were to move or leave for some unknown reason.

Feel free to fork this repo and adapt it to your own purposes! We also would love to learn from the experiences of other organizations! If you have any advice, please submit a pull request!
